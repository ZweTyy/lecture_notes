# **Analysis, Design and Software Architecture (BDSA)**
Session 4
[Helge Pfeiffer, Assistant Professor](ropf@itu.dk)


## Plan for today

- First hour: Feedback, Integration Patterns, and HTTP Intro
- Second hour: HTTP recap and Intro to Minimal Web API applications
- Third hour: Properties of ASP.Net Minimal Web applications
- Fourth hour: Deployment of Web applications


## Feedback: Cool

- You work on your projects
- You already learned a lot of new and complicated stuff

But ... :)

## Feedback: Use semantic versioning for your releases

![bg right:30% 100% ](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*7h56wnp4mqlOqRm4aF9cTQ.png)


- So tags and versions that look like 1.0.1 or v2.0.2 are good version numbers.
- Version numbers 0.5, v1. 2 are not

A good filename for a release contains the name of the project, the release version, and the target platform. That is,

* `Chirp.CLI-v.0.0.4-linux-x64.zip`, `Chirp-0.9.2-win-x64.zip`, or `chirp-v1.0.1-osx-arm64.zip` are all good release names.
* `linux-x64.tar.gz`, `Chirp-test_release-osx-x64.tar.gz`, `App-v0.1.8-macos.zip`, `v1.1.13`, etc. are all less good release names.

</font>


## Feedback: Release what and how?

- Read precisely: publish only ZIP files for all three executables, no other compressed archive format (this is only for this course)
* Release only compressed executables (single-file, platform dependent), **no other artifacts**
  *  That is, no CSV files, no `*.sln` files , etc.
  * **single-file**: Release contains exactly _one_ file, if you have more than that, you publish wrongly.
  * **platform dependent**: Not the entire .NET runtime bundled!
  * That is, likely your releases will be 0.5MB in size (ca. 500KB) not ca. 63MB

* Most important: **Only working executables are released**!
  * > [Software Quality...] degree to which a software product satisfies stated and implied needs when used under specified conditions<font size=3>

</font>


## Feedback

- 7 groups (ca. 27%) do not have a release yet?
- Remember, project work is graded and forms 2/3 of the final grade!


## Feedback

> One database file is actually quite unpractical for testing and "production".

üëèüëèüëè

Absolutely, that is true! I wanted you to experience that.
What could you do to allow for testing and production ?

@Helge: draw these as images on black board

We will talk more about this design problem next time.

<!-- First hour -->

## Architecture: Integration Patterns

<!--
_backgroundImage: "linear-gradient(to bottom, #deb887, #d17e12)"
_color: white
-->

- Why is our _Chirp!_ application not cool yet?
  * It is not a social network, all cheeps are stored per user on the computer that runs the program.

* How can we modify our _Chirp!_ application so that it becomes a social network, i.e., so that we can read each other's cheeps?

* @Helge: with discussion from audience draw possible solutions on the blackboard

<!-- NFS, DB, WS, WA -->


## Task: Experiment with a distributed _Chirp!_ CLI system

<!--
_backgroundImage: "linear-gradient(to bottom, #67b8e3, #0288d1)"
_color: white
_header: 10 minutes
-->

- Download a new _Chirp!_ CLI client for your operating system: [Windows](clients/win/chirp.exe), [MacOS](clients/osx/chirp), or [Linux (and WSL)](clients/linux/chirp)
  - On MacOS/WSL/Linux make the file executable: `chmod u+x ~/Downloads/chirp`
- Write a cheep from the terminal with the new client
  - **OBS**: the usual netiquette applies, i.e., write only messages that you would utter at your grandma's coffee table
  - **OBS**: For now, write short cheeps, i.e., a single sentence.
  - `cd ~/Downloads`
  - `chirp[.exe] cheep "Hello!"` (Only Windows users have to add the `.exe` suffix)
- Now, read yours and your peer's cheeps on the terminal, e.g., via:
  - `chirp[.exe] read`
- Can you see cheeps that were not written by you? This is the goal for this lecture and this week's project work.


## How does this work?

How can the client that I have locally on my computer display cheeps that were written by my peers?

## Task: Send and Inspect HTTP Requests and Responses in the Browser

<style scoped>

}
</style>

<!--
_backgroundImage: "linear-gradient(to bottom, #67b8e3, #0288d1)"
_color: white
_header: 10 minutes
-->

- Open your web browser
- Open its development tools (press F12 on Firefox, Edge, ...)
- Switch to the `Network` tab
- Enter the URL <https://chirpremotedb.azurewebsites.net/cheeps> in the address bar and hit return
- In the `Network` tab, click on the `GET` (blue document icon in Safari/Edge) request to the domain `chirpremotedb.azurewebsites.net`
- Inspect the headers and bodies of the sent request and the received response.
- Discuss with your neighbors what you see.

![bg right 50% 100%](images/inspector.png)


## Task: Send and Inspect HTTP Requests and Responses  via `curl`

<!--
_backgroundImage: "linear-gradient(to bottom, #67b8e3, #0288d1)"
_color: white
_header: 5 minutes
-->

- Open your terminal
- Send an HTTP request with the `curl` command
```bash
curl -v --header "accept: application/json" https://chirpremotedb.azurewebsites.net/cheeps
```
- Inspect the output and discuss it with your neighbors.
- If in doubt about the meaning of the provided options, read the corresponding documentation via `man curl` in the terminal.
- Discuss with your neighbors the output of the `curl` command and compare it to what you saw in the browser's network tool in the previous task.


## What was that?

- @Helge  Afterwards
  - show, inspect and explain the output of the command
  - show alternative in VS Code request tool

GET https://chirpremotedb.azurewebsites.net/cheeps


## Recap: Structure of HTTP Requests and Responses

![w:1000px](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Messages/httpmsgstructure2.png)

  > - A start-line
  > - An optional set of HTTP headers
  > - A blank line indicating all meta-information for the request has been sent.
  > - An optional body containing data associated with the request.<font size=3>

## Recap: HTTP headers

|Header Field |Description |Examples                                               |
|:------------|:-----------|:------------------------------------------------------|
|Accept       |I understand|`text/plain`<br>`application/json`<br>`application/xml`|
|Content-Type |I'm sending |`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`<br>`application/json; charset=utf-8`|
|Authorization|Who I am    |`Bearer ey`                                            |


## Recap: Kinds of HTTP Requests

Actions work on [_resources_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Identifying_resources_on_the_Web), i.e., the "thing" specified by the URL

|Action                 |Verb    |
|:----------------------|:-------|
|Request/Retrieve       |`GET`   |
|Like `GET` without body|`HEAD`  |
|Submit                 |`POST`  |
|Update/Replace         |`PUT`   |
|Delete                 |`DELETE`|
|Update/Modify          |`PATCH` |

More details on HTTP verbs: [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods)


## Recap: Kinds of HTTP Responses, Status Codes

|Codes      |Meaning                  |

## Task: Create an ASP.NET Minimal Web API

<!--
_backgroundImage: "linear-gradient(to bottom, #67b8e3, #0288d1)"
_color: white
_header: 15 minutes
-->

- Create a new minimal web api project:
```bash
dotnet new web -o Chirp.CSVDBService
```
- Thereafter, change directory to `cd Chirp.CSVDBService`
- Inspect the source code that was generated, especially `Program.cs`
- Build and run the project via `dotnet run`
  * Note the URL that is listed after `Now listening on:`
- In another terminal, send an HTTP `GET` request with `curl` to the application. (e.g., `curl -v http://localhost:5012`, or whichever other URL is listed after `Now listening on:`)
- Study and interpret the output with your neighbors.
- Repeat the process with the development tools of your browser
- Once done, stop the web service by pressing `CTRL+C`.


## Inspecting Example HTTP Request and Response

```
$ curl -v http://localhost:5012
*   Trying 127.0.0.1:5012...
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 5012 (#0)
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:5012
> User-Agent: curl/7.81.0
> Accept: */*
>
* Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
< Date: Tue, 04 Jul 2023 11:08:02 GMT
< Server: Kestrel
< Transfer-Encoding: chunked
<
* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
Hello World!
```

@Helge: Explain the output above


## Building Web APIs

The application in the previous example returns a string in the body of the HTTP message, see the output of `curl`.

Web applications may return other kinds of data too.
- Web APIs often return data that is encoded as JSON.
- Web applications return most often HTML.


## Task: Create an ASP.Net Minimal Web API

<!--
_backgroundImage: "linear-gradient(to bottom, #67b8e3, #0288d1)"
_color: white
_header: 15 minutes
-->

- Restart the web api project from the previous task, now not with `dotnet run` but with `dotnet watch`.
- In another terminal, send an HTTP `GET` request with `curl` to the application. (e.g., `curl http://localhost:5012`, or whichever other URL is listed after `Now listening on:`)
- Modify the `Program.cs` from the previous task so that line 4 is replaced with
  ```csharp
  app.MapGet("/cheeps", () => new Cheep("me", "Hej!", 1684229348));
  ```
  and append the following line as new last line to `Program.cs`
  ```csharp
  public record Cheep(string Author, string Message, long Timestamp);
  ```
- In another terminal, send an HTTP `GET` request with `curl` to the new `cheeps` endpoint (e.g., `curl http://localhost:5012/cheeps`)
- What is the `Content-Type` of the HTTP response?


## Anonymous functions in C‚ôØ

- What was that???
  ```csharp
  () => new Cheep("me", "Hej!", 1684229348)
  ```

* Anonymous functions [also called lambdas] in C‚ôØ:
  * _Expression lambda_ that has an expression as its body:
    ```csharp
    (input-parameters) => expression
    ```
  * _Statement lambda_ that has a statement block as its body:
    ```csharp
    (input-parameters) => { <sequence-of-statements> }
    ```
<font size=3>
Source: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/lambda-expressions">Microsoft Documentation</a>
</font>

@Helge: Show in code example how that would look like with normal method


## ASP.NET Automatically Serializes Objects into JSON for Transport over HTTP

The `Cheep` object from the following code

```csharp
app.MapGet("/cheeps", () => new Cheep("me", "Hej!", 1684229348));
```

gets automatically serialized into JSON by the ASP.NET Core framework:

```json
{"author":"me","message":"Hej!","timestamp":1684229348}
```

The same holds for the other way around. When you send a JSON object in a message body that has all corresponding fields, a C‚ôØ object can be created automatically from that, e.g.,

```csharp
app.MapPost("/cheep", (Cheep cheep) => { ... });
```


## Web API??? What is that?

<style scoped>
pre {
   font-size: 24px;
}
section {
  font-size: 24px;
}
</style>

A Web _application programming interface (API)_ is an API that is accessible via a network

```csharp
WebApplicationBuilder builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
WebApplication app = builder.Build();
...
// This is your Web API
app.MapGet("/cheeps", () => { ... });
app.MapPost("/cheep", (Cheep cheep) => { ... });

app.Run();
```
A "regular" _application programming interface (API)_ is an API that is accessible in code directly

```csharp
namespace Chirp.SimpleDB;

public interface IDatabaseRepository<T>
{
    public IEnumerable<T> Read(int? limit = null);
    public void Store(T record);
}
```


## Architecture: Our First Architectural Pattern

<!--

What kind of application did we build with `Chirp.CSVDBService` and `curl` or the web browser?

- A client-server application

## Sending and Receiving HTTP Requests programmatically in C‚ôØ/.NET

```csharp
using System.Net;
using System.Net.Http.Headers;
using System.Net.Http.Json;

// Create an HTTP client object
var baseURL = "http://localhost:5012";
using HttpClient client = new();
client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Clear();
client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Add(new MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue("application/json"));
client.BaseAddress = new Uri(baseURL);

// Send an asynchronous HTTP GET request and automatically construct a Cheep object from the
// JSON object in the body of the response
var cheep = await client.GetFromJsonAsync<Cheep>("cheeps");


public record Cheep(string Author, string Message, long Timestamp);
```


## Task: Brief Intro to Asynchronous Programming in C‚ôØ/.NET

<!--
_backgroundImage: "linear-gradient(to bottom, #67b8e3, #0288d1)"
_color: white
_header: 10 minutes
-->
What was this `await` keyword?

- In the directory of this lecture notes, you find an example called [`AsyncAwaitHTTP`](./AsyncAwaitHTTP/)
- In its [`src`](./AsyncAwaitHTTP/src/) directory, you find two .NET projects, one HTTP [`Server`](./AsyncAwaitHTTP/src/Server/) and one HTTP [`Client`](./AsyncAwaitHTTP/src/Client/).
- Start the server with `cd ./AsyncAwaitHTTP/src/Server/` followed by `dotnet run` in one terminal window
- Start the client in another terminal window with `cd ./AsyncAwaitHTTP/src/Client/` followed by `dotnet run`.
- Inspect the output of the client program.
- Now try to understand what the client is doing, see [`Program.cs`](./AsyncAwaitHTTP/src/Client/Program.cs).
  -  Discuss with your neighbors what is different in the two ways of calling the HTTP server.
  - Can you see, what makes the second example execute much faster than the first one?


## Brief Intro to Asynchronous Programming in C‚ôØ/.NET


- What was this `await` keyword?

* Network calls take long, for sure way longer than method calls in your programs running on your CPU.

@Helge: Demo on same example, what happens when `await`s in first example of the `Client`'s `Program.cs` are removed?

## Why does it matter?

Methods that are declared as `async` and that return a `Task` object in C‚ôØ and whose results you have to `await` are comparable to concurrent functions that you start with `go` in Go in your distributed systems class.


## Making the CSV DB Server run on the internet

Running an HTTP server locally is good for development.

If you want to make your service accessible for everybody, i.e., if you want to have first version of _Chirp!_ that is a proper social network in which you can read other's cheeps and not only your's, you have to deploy it to the "internet".


## Brief introduction to hosting options.

* Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS)
* Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
* Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)
* Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)


![bg right w:100%](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5612AQERScLK1dDs5Q/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1664917722416?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=jswYEaHPq0gYIzZlE4OV_YphpYTQbDEpd3iRh2LMMy0)

For each of these options, there are many different providers. In this class, we use only Azure Service (a PaaS).
In case you are interested in IaaS, we will deepen that in next semester's elective _"DevOps, Software Evolution and Software Maintenance"_.

## Task: Deploy to App Service Manually

<!--
_backgroundImage: "linear-gradient(to bottom, #67b8e3, #0288d1)"
_color: white
_header: 10 minutes
-->

<style scoped>
pre {

}
section {
  font-size: 20px;
}
</style>

- In a previous task, you created the `Chirp.CSVDBService` minimal Web API project.
- In a terminal switch to this directory `cd <path/to/Chirp.CSVDBService>`.
- Login to App Service. The following should open a browser window indicating that you are now logged in. (Use your ITU credentials to login).
  ```bash
  az login
  ```
- After login, execute the following command. **OBS:** Replace `<no>` with the number of your group. This command deploys the current web application to Azure App Service.
  ```bash
  az webapp up --sku F1 --name bdsagroup<no>chirpremotedb --os-type Linux --location westeurope --runtime DOTNETCORE:7.0
  ```
- Once the commands completes, it should return a URL for your web application. It is likely `https://bdsagroup<no>chirpremotedb.azurewebsites.net` (again replace `<no>` with the number of your group.)
- Now, either with your web browser or with `curl`, send an HTTP GET request to `https://bdsagroup<no>chirpremotedb.azurewebsites.net/cheeps`.
- Do you receive a JSON object that corresponds to the following `Cheep` object?
  ```csharp
  new Cheep("me", "Hej!", 1684229348)
  ```


## Manually Deploy to Azure App Service

- Remember to take down the web service that you just deployed with `az webapp delete`, see `az webapp --help` in case you are in doubt of what you can do with a webapp on Azure App Service.

## Automatically Deploy to App Service

<style scoped>
pre {

section {

}
</style>

- In your project work, you will add a step to your CI pipeline on GitHub Actions that deploys to Azure App Service automatically.
* You decide if that happens on every push to main, on a tag of a new version, etc.
* Why can't you just have another CI step that looks like in the following?

  ```yml
  name: Deploy

  on:
    push:
      branches: [ "main" ]

  jobs:
    deploy:
      name: Deploy

      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Checkout
          uses: actions/checkout@v3
  ...
        - name: Deploy
          shell: bash
          run: |
            az login
            az webapp up --sku F1 --name bdsagroup<no>chirpremotedb --os-type Linux --location westeurope --runtime DOTNETCORE:7.0
            az logout
  ```

## Automatically Deploy to App Service

<style scoped>
pre {
   font-size: 20px;
}
section {
  font-size: 20px;
}
</style>

In your project work, you will create a deployment workflow that will look similar to the following:

```yml
...
  deploy:
    permissions:
      contents: none
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build>
    environment:
      name: 'Development'
      url: ${{ steps.deploy-to-webapp.outputs.webapp-url }}

    steps:
      - name: Download artifact from build job
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: .net-app

      - name: Deploy to Azure Web App
        id: deploy-to-webapp
        uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v2
        with:
          app-name: ${{ env.AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME }}
          publish-profile: ${{ secrets.AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE }}
          package: ${{ env.AZURE_WEBAPP_PACKAGE_PATH }}
```

## Design: The Pipeline Pattern

<!--
_backgroundImage: "linear-gradient(to bottom, #deb887, #d17e12)"
_color: white
-->

ASP.NET application's middle ware uses the pipeline pattern to handle HTTP requests.

```csharp
WebApplicationBuilder builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
WebApplication app = builder.Build();

// Configuration of the app's middleware pipeline
app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
app.UseStaticFiles();
app.UseRouting();

app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World!");
app.Run();
```

>  - Chooses whether to pass the request to the next component in the pipeline.
>  - Can perform work before and after the next component in the pipeline.

## Recommendation: Write _Short_ Units of Code

<!--
_backgroundImage: "linear-gradient(to bottom, #e18ac2, #d112a5)"
_color: white
-->

> **The 80/24 Rule**
>
> Write small blocks of code.
>
> In C-based languages like C#, Java, C++, or JavaScript, consider staying within a 80 √ó 24 character box. That corresponds to an old terminal window.
>
> Don‚Äôt take the threshold values 80 and 24 too literally. I picked them for three reasons:
>
> - They work well in practice
> - Continuity with tradition
> - Mnemonically, it sounds like the Pareto principle, also known as the 80/20 rule
>
> You can decide on other threshold values. I think the most important part of this rule is to pick a set of thresholds and consistently stay within those limits.<font size=3>

## Recommendation: Separate Kinds of Code

<!--
_backgroundImage: "linear-gradient(to bottom, #e18ac2, #d112a5)"
_color: white
-->

> **Command Query Separation**
>
> Separate Commands from Queries. Commands are procedures that have side effects. Queries are functions that return data. Every method should be either a Command or a Query, but not both.<font size=3>
Source: Mark Seemann <i>"Code That Fits in Your Head"</i>
</font>


## Recommendation: Hierarchy of Communication

<!--
_backgroundImage: "linear-gradient(to bottom, #e18ac2, #d112a5)"
_color: white
-->

> **Hierarchy of Communication**
>
> Write code for future readers; it may be yourself. Favour communicating behaviour and intent according to this prioritised list:
>
> 1. Guide the reader by giving APIs distinct types.
> 2. Guide the reader by giving methods helpful names.
> 3. Guide the reader by writing good comments.
> 4. Guide the reader by providing illustrative examples as automated tests.
> 5. Guide the reader by writing helpful commit messages in Git.
> 6. Guide the reader by writing good documentation.
>
> The items on the top of the list are more important than the items at the bottom.<font size=3>
